# Features needed

## For balloting / campaigning

* Give phone banker permission visibility of notes field, ability to edit
* Quick report for participated member IDs
* Comparison graph should have "others" point for depts < 10
* On departmental turnout chart, style differently those above and below average

## More generally

* Highlight permissions held on reps list
* More structured list of branch offices and holders (can be done as a notice, of course)
** could link to roles/permissions in-app as well, potentially?

## Interface improvements


## Data retention improvements

* Implement "dispute+3" cleanup of old campaigns. Probably needs a dispute object to link them to so that it can be configured properly. (No hurry, just sometime before 2025)

## For testing

* More tests for workplaces
* More tests for ballots
