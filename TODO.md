# Features needed

## For balloting / campaigning

* Campaigns: bulk move wait -> yes
* Graphs of turnout, basic linear projection
* Graphs of departmental turnout, on-track lines

## More generally

* Highlight permissions held on reps list
* More structured list of branch offices and holders (can be done as a notice, of course)
** could link to roles/permissions in-app as well, potentially?

## Interface improvements

* HTML editor for the admin tools which allow HTML

## Data retention improvements

* Joiners-and-leavers log (retained for a couple of weeks only) for management of induction/cleanup tasks
* Implement "dispute+3" cleanup of old campaigns. Probably needs a dispute object to link them to so that it can be configured properly. (No hurry, just sometime before 2025)

## For testing

* More tests for workplaces
* More tests for ballots
