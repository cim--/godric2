# Features needed

## For balloting

* Phonebanker role - can search by name, department, etc. and set
  participation details for current campaigns.
  
## More generally

* Internal message and notice functionality
* Petition functionality
* Basic online voting functionality
* Signup functionality that's a bit more generic than a campaign (e.g. picketing slots)
* List of branch offices and holders
** could link to roles/permissions in-app as well, potentially?

## Interface improvements

* Move the 'any role' prefix out of 'reps' (when things are quieter)
