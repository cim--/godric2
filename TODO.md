# Features needed

## For balloting / campaigning

* Allow campaigns to be given restrictfield/restrictvalue for more localised work. (Workplace can be used to construct an arbitrary restriction this way)
* Allow collection of preference-list ballots (counting them is probably out of scope, so some sort of export)

## More generally

* Add "date joined branch" column to rep report and export.
* Highlight permissions held on reps list
* More structured list of branch offices and holders (can be done as a notice, of course)
** could link to roles/permissions in-app as well, potentially?

## Interface improvements


## Data retention improvements

* Implement "dispute+3" cleanup of old campaigns. Probably needs a dispute object to link them to so that it can be configured properly. (No hurry, just sometime before 2025)

## For testing

* More tests for workplaces
* More tests for ballots
